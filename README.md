## 🧠 Methodology

This project was built using the **Scrum** methodology, broken down into iterative **tasks** and **milestones**.  
Each feature or section (such as navigation, hero layout, responsive cards, overlays, scroll button, etc.) was developed and reviewed step-by-step, ensuring clarity and focus throughout the process.

Key practices included:

- Daily check-ins and review of completed items  
- A backlog of features prioritized by functionality and user experience  
- Refactoring and improvements (like CSS DRY, accessibility, performance tweaks) during refinement phases  
- Use of commits that reflect specific tasks, making the codebase easy to navigate and maintain

This structured approach allowed for continuous delivery, testing, and visual feedback throughout the process.
